Repositories of Open Custody Protocol and its services. 

## Overview

OCP introduces an innovative relayer mechanism that seamlessly connects applications to a modular permissionless custody protocol. OCP operates a protocol that acts akin to a mesh network, enabling an end-user to leverage a diverse set of key management protocols. We call this “Keychain Aggregation”. Building a protocol that solves for Keychain Aggregation not only simplifies the way developers can build, abstracting risk and complexity, but it also harmonizes and aggregates the economics associated with having multiple bilateral commercial relationships.

## Public Roadmap
We are committed to building in public and maintaining transparency in our development process. To track all of our work in progress, we have created a public roadmap where everyone can track our progress. Some of the initial projects we are working on require audits before publishing them live on GitHub. Our top priority over the coming months is to make everything public, open-source, and transparent.
